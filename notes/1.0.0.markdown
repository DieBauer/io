### Features, fixes, changes with compatibility implications

- IO uses the package name `sbt.io`, but it will be imported under `sbt` in sbt/sbt.
- `Path.relativizeFile(baseFile, file)` is renamed to `IO.relativizeFile(baseFile, file)`.
- `PathFinder.x_!(mapper)` moved to `def pair` on `PathFinder`.
- `PathFinder`'s `***` method is moved to `allPaths` method.

### Improvements

- `Path.directory` and `Path.contentOf` are donated from sbt-native-packager #38 by @muuki88.
- `WatchService` that abstracts `PollingWatchService` and Java NIO. #47 by @Duhemm on behalf of The Scala Center.
- Adds variants of `IO.copyFile` and `IO.copyDirectory` that accept `sbt.io.CopyOptions()`. See below for details.

### CopyOptions

sbt IO 1.0 add variant of `IO.copyFile` and `IO.copyDirectory` that accept `sbt.io.CopyOptions()`.
`CopyOptions()` is an example of pseudo case class similar to the builder pattern.

```scala
import sbt.io.{ IO, CopyOptions }

IO.copyDirectory(source, target)

// The above is same as the following
IO.copyDirectory(source, target, CopyOptions()
  .withOverwrite(false)
  .withPreserveLastModified(true)
  .withPreserveExecutable(true))
```
